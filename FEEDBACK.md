## Feedback — P117 (pending commit)

### Assumption that turned out wrong
- Spec says "in the frontend confirmation callback (wherever `validateExecution`
  result is consumed and the PATCH to /api/log-swap is called), pass
  `mevSavingsActual: result.surplusWei` in the PATCH body". But `validateExecution`
  is a server-only module (RPC client, KV access, auto-disable side effects) and
  its HTTP route is bearer-token gated. The frontend has no path to consume
  `ExecutionValidation` directly without exposing the auto-disable side effects.

  Implemented two complementary writes instead:
  1. **Non-CoW path:** `/api/monitor/validate-execution` route (server-side)
     now writes `swaps.mev_savings_actual` directly via Supabase whenever
     `result.surplusWei` is non-null. The existing executor pipeline calls this
     endpoint after each on-chain confirmation, so all non-CoW sources get
     surplus persisted without exposing a public surplus endpoint.
  2. **CoW path:** `useSwap.ts` now calls `updateSwapStatus(...)` with the
     computed surplus on fulfilled CoW orders. Previously the CoW path computed
     `mevSurplusActualWei` but only stored it in component state — the row in
     `swaps` never got PATCHed at all on CoW fulfillment (the wagmi
     `swapConfirmed` effect only fires for `sendTransaction` flows).

### Edge case
- Existing CoW success path never called `updateSwapStatus` — the row stayed
  `pending` forever after a successful CoW order. Now confirmed via the new
  PATCH call. Not strictly in scope for P117 surplus instrumentation, but the
  spec required wiring `mevSavingsActual` into the PATCH for the CoW path, and
  this is the natural place.
